# Tetris
An algorithm which solves a random polynomial region with tetromino pieces, using binary logic.

Contains 4 files:
 1. An example main function to run the algorithm, given the correct input parameters.
 2. The Find Solution function, responsible for finding all possible solutions.
 3. The Piece Bin class, containing the tetromino piece database for the reduced grid size.
 4. The Target class, responsible for creating the new solvable target and outputting the solution.
